# Welcome to Frances Marquez' README!
## 🧠 --> 💻
I am currently in my 2nd year at Western University, but first year in my program, CompSci.
I was previously in Psych, but that didn't really work out.

## Some fun facts about me | 👩‍🦰
- 🧶 I obsess over new hobbies and forget about them in 3 weeks: current interests are knitting and crocheting
- 🍪 I make really good snickerdoodles
- 🧀 I really like cheese
