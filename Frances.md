# Welcome to Frances Marquez' README!
I am currently in my 2nd year at Western University, but first year in my program, CompSci.
I was previously in Psych, but that didn't really work out.

## Some fun facts about me:
- I obsess over new hobbies and forget about them in 3 weeks: current interests are knitting and crocheting
- I make really good snickerdoodles
- I really like cheese
