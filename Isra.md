# Welcom to Isra Tanveer's README!
## :test_tube: :pill: :syringe:
I am in my fourth and final year of health sciences and am looking forward to graduating! I don't know what I want to do after graduating, which is why I have been exploring different areas of study. In fact, that's why I'm at Hacker Olympics this weekend!

## Some fun facts about me | :woman:
- :pakistan: I am from Pakistan
- :books: I love to read! My favourite book is A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini
- :speaking_head: I am trilingual

## My favourite song | :notes:
