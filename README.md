None of us are in the same program and we just met, but we make it work!

# About Us
## How did we come up with our name? | 📔
We first tried to come up with shared interests. Since there's three of us, we started brainstorming about groups that had 3 members. The most memorable one was The Three Musketeers. We found that we have a shared interest in cats (unrelated to the name) and are in a hackathon together. So.. The Three Hackateers. 

## Why did we join the Hacker Olympics? | 🥇
We're a very curious group of indivduals. We are always willing to learn something new. Competition is also something that intrigues all of us... Joining the Hacker Olympics seemed like the perfect opportunity.
